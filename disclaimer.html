        <p>I have never seen a Star Wars film. There may be pictures of planets in the wrong timeline et cetera.</p>
        <p>Background images were obtained from NASA JET Lab photo archives in accordance with their <a href= "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jpl-image-use-policy">image usage policy</a></p>
        <p>The Star Wars logo edit used on the people was done by me.</p>
        <p>All other images are from Star Wars films themselves.</p>
